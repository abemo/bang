# Bang!

A compiler for the programming language bang!

See the official documentation [here](https://nklau-bang.notion.site/nklau-bang/add467ede3dd452981516c57526a2991?v=f94f70ba09af4c369717612ca7803e87).

Many enterprise programming languages are overly verbose, and they frequently limit the programmer in functionality or force the developer to come up with a lengthy workaround to avoid errors like null reference exceptions or type errors. Bang! is a dynamically and weakly typed expression-based scripting language that prioritizes concise syntax and flexibility, and is an ideal choice for code golfing.

## Code of Conduct

Feel free to add or recommend any features or changes to the language. If you do, please do so with kindness and consideration for all other contributors, users, and people across the globe. "Bang!" uses the MIT license.
