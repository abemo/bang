Aidan Dionisio and I worked together at a high-level for this assignment, although we each had our own individual documents.

1.1) Requirements gathering, high-level design, low-level design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, wrap-up

1.2) **Requirements gathering:** The customer's wants/needs are put into a document that tells customers what they will be getting and project members what they will be building.

**High-level design:** High-level design includes decisions like platform choice and project structure, which breaks it down into modules, determines what each module should do, and how the modules interact.

**Low-level design:** Each module is assigned to a group within the project, and how each module should work is determined.

**Development:** Programmers write the code to implement each module, doing their best to ensure their code remains as bug-free as possible.

**Testing:** Both developers and testers test the code and fix any bugs they find, and the new code is integrated into the rest of the project, which gets tested and bug-fixed as a whole.

**Deployment:** Software gets rolled out to users, and often, unexpected problems show up, so extra time should be built into the schedule for deployment.

**Maintenance:** Users will find bugs that need to be fixed that were missed during testing and deployment, and they also may request additional features that weren't included in the initial product.

**Wrap-up:** The developers should write a post-mortem to evaluate the project to determine what went well, what went poorly, and how to repeat or prevent those things it in the future.

2.4) The version history in Google Docs, which allows you to name document versions, also tracks the time it was saved at and the people who have made edits to that version. Any changes from the previous version of the document to the current version get highlighted. Each person is assigned a different color, and their edits are highlighted in that color in the document’s version view.

2.5) JBGE stands for "just barely good enough." It is the idea that programmers should provide a minimal amount of code documentation/comments because too much documentation will waste a lot of programmers’ time updating it as they write/edit code.

4.2) The total expected duration of the project is 32 working days. The tasks along a critical path are G, D, E, M, and Q.

4.4) See linked [Gantt Chart](./homework1GanttChart.pdf).

4.6) Preparing ahead of time for unexpected scheduling delays can prevent the project from being delayed unexpectedly. For example, adding tasks like "sick time" or "vacation time" to the schedule helps provide a buffer in case unpredicted delays come up.

4.8) The first biggest mistake is to ignore when a developer falls behind on a scheduled task and assume you can make up the lost time later. The second biggest mistake is to pile extra developers on the task and assume they can reduce the time needed to finish it.

5.1) Good requirements should be clear, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, and verifiable.

5.3) The project has no implementation requirements because none of the requirements have to do with transitioning from an old system to a new system, assuming that the system is new and is not replacing any existing system.

5.9) 
- The system must reveal the mystery word on a loss.
- The system should keep track of the current session's number of wins and losses.
- The system should keep track of the current number of sequential wins.
- The system could have a local leaderboard based on longest win streak.
- The system could have multiple levels of difficulty based on word length.
- The system won't have multiple cosmetic themes for the GUI.
