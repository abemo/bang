| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x = 17 \nstring greeting = "hello" \n const decayRate = 0.05` | TODO!:                                                                                   |
| `sum = (x, y) -> x + y`                                        | `function sum(x, y) {return x + y}`                                                      |
| `5.times(print("hello world"))`                                | `for(let _ = 0; _ < 5; _++){console.log("hello world")} `                                |
| `5.times(print(i), i)`                                         | `for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){console.log(i)} `                                            |
| `enoughDogs ? print("there are enough dogs")`                  | `if (enoughDogs) {console.log("there are enough dogs)}`                                  |
