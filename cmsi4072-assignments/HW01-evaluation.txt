problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 I like the should requirements ~ the logic games I play have the
   same statistics you have mentioned and it adds a lot to see how I'm doing
   as well as to keep me playing "just one more round" to see if I can beat
   my score.

Good job on this you two, and keep up the good work!
