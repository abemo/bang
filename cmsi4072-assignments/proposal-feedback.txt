CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Natalie Lau
BANG! Computer Language project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  Very complete in its explanation and where
   you got the idea.  This is the most computer science-y of all of the
   projects this semester!  VERY exciting.

   The justification section is also well done, specifying very specifically
   what knowledge you are pulling from to create the project.  It's also
   nice to see the self-reflection that you exhibit when stating that you do
   want to add things that you weren't able to finish last semester for the
   reasons you state.

   Very well done document overall, plus, I learned about 'code golf' and I
   like that you put in the example of left associativity and how it gives
   different results in different languages!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  I'm sorry there weren't more questions for
   you about this engaging project.  Perhaps your project is a little bit too
   technical for some of the audience to really appreciate what you are
   doing, but that's on THEM not on YOU.  Your slides were great, and your
   presentation style/manner were spot-on.  You explained everything very
   well.

   Great job overall!

=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
