Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.  Thanks for letting me know that you and Aidan
worked together.  I'm glad that you two collaborated and were still able to
turn in individualized versions!  Excellent!

On 5.2, good point for a rule-based architecture in terms of the game having
a set of rules that must be followed in order to play.  However, in the case
of 'architecture', a rule-based system is something different.  It uses sets
of rules and sets of 'facts' which trigger the rules; this is the kind of an
architecture you would use for diagnostics like in health care or car repair
but I'm sure it could be adapted for games.  You bring up a good point and I
will see about implementing tic-tac-toe as a sample for CMSI 627!

On 5.8, it looks like you have a transition missing.  There's no way to get
from the "E/e" to a digit without entering a sign but that should still be a
valid entry.  For example, "1.234e5" is the same as "1.234e+5" and both are
allowed.

On 6.1, good thinking to include the "LineStyle" property... I don't think
anyone else thought of using dashed or dotted lines!

Great job, Natalie ~ keep up the good work!!
